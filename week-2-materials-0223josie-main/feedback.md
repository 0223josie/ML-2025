## Problem Breakdown

### Exercise 1 (9/10 = 90.0%)

**Part ex1-part1** (ex1-part1.answer): 4/5 points

_Feedback:_ Good attempt! You covered key EDA techniques for numeric and categorical data. However, the explanation for the relationship between categorical and numeric data is more about ML modeling than EDA. Including specific EDA techniques like grouped boxplots would improve it.

**Part ex1-part2** (ex1-part2.code): 5/5 points

_Feedback:_ Excellent work! You generated the data correctly and applied a comprehensive set of EDA techniques, including descriptive stats, histograms, correlation, and ANOVA tests. Your approach aligns well with your prior work. Keep up the great effort!

### Exercise 2 (10/10 = 100.0%)

**Part 2-part1** (2-part1.code): 10/10 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You generated a dataset with 1000 rows and 6 columns, including a boolean target, a categorical column, and 4 numeric columns with different scales. You also added 5% nulls and used a noisy function for the target. Well done!

### Exercise 3 (9/10 = 90.0%)

**Part ex2-part1** (ex2-part1.fill): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You successfully implemented the pipeline with separate processing for numeric and categorical features, and used cross-validation with logistic regression. The use of StratifiedKFold is a nice touch for classification tasks. Your solution meets all the requirements.

**Part ex2-part2** (ex2-part2.code): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You correctly used RandomForestClassifier with run_classifier and printed the results. The parameters for RandomForest are well-chosen, and your reflection prompt is thoughtful. Your implementation aligns well with your prior work.

**Part ex2-part3** (ex2-part3.answer): 2/3 points

_Feedback:_ Your explanation is reasonable, but it contradicts the expected outcome. Logistic Regression should perform better due to the linear nature of the data. You correctly noted Random Forests handle non-linearities and outliers well, but missed the linear setup.
