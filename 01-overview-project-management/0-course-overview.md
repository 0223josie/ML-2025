# Course Overview

The syllabus (available on blackboard) is the most authoritative and up-to-date place for information about the schedule and / or policies.  You are responsible for reviewing it on a regular basis!  The instructor will strive to notify you of any updates.

## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with Python
* Experience with Jupyter notebooks
* Knowledge of basic data manipulation using Pandas and Numpy

If you do not have this experience, please talk to me.

## Class Flow
* All materials will be made available via the GitHub Education platform.
  * Every week, there will be an assignment to accept on GitHub education
  * The assignment will include lab materials, study questions, and a homework assignment to be submitted before the next class
  * I will commit a "feedback.md" file with your grade on the assignment and update your grade on blackboard
* You are expected to review lecture materials for the week  _before_ class
* Readings from the book are chosen to enhance and support materials from the notebooks.
* I will call on several people randomly in each class to ask questions from the materials for the week. Yur answers will determine your participation grade. You will be penalized if you are not present.  The "questions.md" file in each weekly assignment folder will indicate the kinds of questions I am likely to ask.
  * Class attendance is mandatory. Any student not in class will receive -1 on their participation grade.
* There is one large group project that will require weekly effort
  * Updates to the WORKLOG and WORKPLAN as well as fresh commits to the project repository are required on a weekly basis (see below).
* Class time will be split between lecture and lab.
  * Lectures will be driven in part by your questions; there is far more material in the notebooks than can be covered in class.  This is by design.
  * Class work will be done in pairs


## Assignments (IST707)

* **12 Weekly Assignments**
  * In most weeks, there will be a simple homework assignment, due before the next class
* **Group Project**
  * End-to-end ML Project: Pick your own data and problem.  Use any techniques you want.
  * The project will stretch out overall most of the semester. You will work in teams of 3-5. You will submit regular updates to your vision, workplan, and worklog. These incremental submissions will make up roughly half of your project grade.
  * Please see the syllabus for additional details

## Assignment / Report Format

* All homeworks will be submitted as Jupyter notebooks
* Project submissions will include
  * A Jupyter notebook with code
  * Supporting .py files as necessary
  * A proposal and final report in [GitHub flavored markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github).
    * No spelling or grammar errors\, any equations properly formatted
