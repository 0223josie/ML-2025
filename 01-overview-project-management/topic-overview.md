# Lecture Topic Overview: Course Overview and Project Management

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
- Understand course structure and expectations
- Define machine learning and understand its historical development from theoretical foundations to modern applications
- Identify key application areas across industries and understand ethical considerations in ML
- Navigate the Python ML ecosystem and understand interconnections between core libraries
- Apply fundamental Python programming concepts including variables, data structures, control flow, functions, and classes
- Manipulate data using NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames
- Understand ML project management principles and the Heilmeier Catechism

## Topics Covered
**Course Administration:**
- Course policies, grading structure, and assignment formats
- Flipped classroom methodology and participation expectations
- GitHub-based workflow and Jupyter notebook requirements

**Machine Learning Foundations:**
- Historical evolution from Hobbes (1651) through Turing (1950) to modern AI (1956+)
- Multiple definitions of ML from Mitchell, Samuel, Murphy, and Géron
- Real-world applications across healthcare, finance, e-commerce, automotive, energy, and entertainment
- Communication challenges in ML and ethical considerations (Google Flu Trends, IBM Watson, COMPAS case study)

**Python ML Ecosystem:**
- Python as the foundation language for ML development
- Pandas for data import, wrangling, and analysis
- NumPy for numerical computations and array operations
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning model development

**Programming Fundamentals Review:**
- Variables, data types, and operations
- Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- Indexing, slicing, and list comprehensions
- Control flow (if statements, for/while loops)
- Functions, classes, inheritance, and object-oriented programming
- Decorators and callbacks for advanced customization

## Practical Skills
After completing this section, students can:
- Set up and navigate Jupyter notebook environments
