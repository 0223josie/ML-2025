## Problem Breakdown

### Exercise 1 (8/10 = 80.0%)

**Part iris_one-part1** (iris_one-part1.code): 5/7 points

_Feedback:_ Good attempt: KMeans over multiple k, standardization, and confusion matrices with optimal alignment. However, your relabeling breaks for k>3 because some clusters aren’t mapped (KeyError). Handle unmapped clusters (e.g., mapping.get(label, -1)) to support k=4,5. ARI extra is fine.

**Part iris_one-part2** (iris_one-part2.answer): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ Good: You justify k=3 using ARI (highest) and confusion matrix alignment, which matches the prior results. Minor nuance: k=2 can look strong by merging versicolor/virginica (fewer off-diagonals), but overall your argument for k=3 as best per ground truth is solid.

### Exercise 2 (3/3 = 100.0%)

**Part ex1-part2** (ex1-part2.answer): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ Correct: you note no clear elbow and that Silhouette (higher better) and Davies–Bouldin (lower better) both point to k=2, while ground truth favors k=3. Good explanation of overlap causing the mismatch and limits of internal metrics. Well done.

### Exercise 3 (9/10 = 90.0%)

**Part ex2-part1** (ex2-part1.code): 7/8 points

_Feedback:_ Good work: HAC with multiple linkages and dendrograms, plus KMeans with inertia/silhouette/DB and best-k identification. Minor gaps: KMeans only explored k=2–5 (broaden range), HAC evaluation fixes k=5 instead of using metrics to pick k, and no explicit stated k choice.

**Part ex2-part2** (ex2-part2.answer): 2/2 points

_Feedback:_ Good: You gave a reasonable guess (5) and correctly noted that internal metrics (often favoring k=2) are guidelines, not truth. This addresses both parts well and aligns with the ambiguity seen in metrics. Nice concise justification.
